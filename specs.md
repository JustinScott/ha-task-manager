# Lists — Home Assistant Application Specification

**Status:** Draft specification for implementation  
**Version:** 0.2 · 2026-11-02  
**Scope:** Provider-independent list management, dedicated Home Assistant UI, Assist voice support, and local suggestions/history.

## 1. Product goals

Build a free, local-first, application-style list manager integrated into Home Assistant. It must support multiple lists (groceries, hardware, home improvement, personal tasks), accessible from Home Assistant on desktop and Android, and usable through Home Assistant Assist. The application must work with native Home Assistant `todo` entities and allow changing providers without rewriting the UI or automations.

**Non-negotiables:** No paid service, billing account, cloud dependency, or Microsoft/Azure registration is required for the default installation. The default backend is Home Assistant Local To-do. Other providers, including Microsoft To Do, are optional and may have independent account/network requirements. No credentials, personal data, local addresses, user task content, or tokens may be committed to the public repository.

### Non-goals (initial release)

- Replacing the native Home Assistant `todo` platform.
- Automatically mirroring all provider-specific fields or guaranteeing seamless migrations between arbitrary providers.
- Building a full project-management or collaboration platform.
- Requiring AI inference, external APIs, or paid services for autocomplete.

## 2. Experience and UI

### Dedicated application shell

- Register a dedicated **Lists** sidebar entry opening a full-page panel, not a collection of scattered dashboard cards.
- Beacon-inspired clean task list, but **show full list names**, not icon-only list navigation.
- Desktop: persistent named-list sidebar, item counts, search, main list pane; optionally resizable split layout.
- Android: responsive list selector showing full names, touch-friendly rows, accessible controls, and a full-screen task editor.
- Follow Home Assistant theme, light/dark mode, spacing, accessibility and safe-area conventions. No separate login or publicly exposed web server.
- Provide loading, empty, offline, permission-denied, and error states; maintain keyboard and screen-reader support.

### Lists and items

- Create, rename, configure, reorder and archive lists **where supported**. A logical application list maps to an explicitly configured `todo` entity; do not assume generic HA services can create/delete provider lists.
- Fast add, checkbox complete/reopen, inline rename, remove with confirmation/undo where feasible, filter active/completed, sorting and searching.
- Clicking an item name opens a richer editor: title, description/instructions, due date, priority, additional notes, links, optional categories, subtasks, reference materials and future attachments.
- Desktop task detail: side pane/dialog; Android: full-screen detail view. Save/cancel and unsaved-change warning.
- List-specific presentation templates: **Simple/Grocery** mode defaults to compact entry; **Projects/Home Improvement** mode enables detailed fields; fields remain accessible regardless of mode.
- Optional grocery enhancements: quantity/unit, store section, frequent items, category grouping, quick-add shortcuts.
- Avoid unnecessary modals, icon-only navigation, swipe-only controls, and popup-only list access.

### Suggestions/autocomplete

- Update suggestions while typing, using case-insensitive prefix/substring matches; allow keyboard/touch selection and normal free-text entry.
- Prefer exact/prefix matches, then recency/frequency; optionally support typo tolerance later.
- Exclude already-active items from the same list (configurable).
- Keep a central **local suggestion catalog**, not browser-local state, so devices share suggestions.
- Seed catalog from provider completed items **when supported**, and learn from additions made through the UI, Assist, and automations when observable.
- Separate catalog per list by default; optionally share suggestions across lists. Store normalized label, display label, last-seen timestamp, frequency, source and list association.
- Provide controls to remove individual suggestions, clear history, disable learning, and rebuild from available provider history.
- Do not treat a provider's completed items as a guaranteed complete purchase history. Avoid double-counting on polling/restarts.

## 3. Provider-independent architecture

      |                       |
Local To-do / Microsoft /  HA-managed persistent storage
other todo entities
```

- Native Home Assistant `todo` entities are the **source of truth** for supported core fields and completion state. Use standard `todo` actions (`todo.add_item`, `todo.update_item`, `todo.remove_item`, `todo.get_items`) as supported by each entity.
- Expose provider capabilities to the UI; do not assume every provider supports descriptions, due dates, completed-item retrieval, or stable item identifiers.
- Persist application-specific metadata (priority, rich notes, subtasks, suggestion history, UI preferences) separately in Home Assistant-managed storage, with schema versions and migration routines.
- Use durable internal item IDs and explicit mapping to provider item IDs when available; never rely on title alone. Define fallback matching and conflict handling when providers expose insufficient identity information.
- **Approved for initial release (Option A):** Provider independence means the UI can bind a logical list to a different native `todo` entity without changing frontend code. This does **not** copy existing tasks; tasks remain with their original provider. Explicitly warn users before changing the binding and preserve local metadata mappings.
- **Future optional goal (Option B; not required for initial release):** Implement a user-initiated, reversible provider migration workflow: export/backup, assess target capabilities, preview mapping, migrate/copy, verify counts and fields, preserve the source until verification, and allow rollback where feasible. Report unsupported fields and conflicts. Do not silently migrate or delete tasks.
- Define conflict rules for changes from multiple clients, stale data, provider errors, duplicate items, and eventual consistency. Do not silently overwrite newer changes.
- Never copy or delete source tasks without explicit user approval.
- Keep provider-specific APIs out of the frontend; define a narrow adapter/service layer in Python.

## 4. Voice and automation integration

- Expose intended `todo` entities to Assist; verify named-list intents route to the correct list.
- Document ambiguity between Home Assistant's built-in Shopping list intent and generic named-list intents. If needed, configure custom sentences/intent scripts that target explicitly selected `todo` entities.
- Support natural requests such as “Add milk to Groceries” and “Add batteries to Hardware Store”; test list names, synonyms, and duplicate handling.
- Prefer native Home Assistant `todo` actions in scripts and automations; keep provider-specific code behind the adapter.
- Provide reusable scripts or documented examples for voice add, mark complete and read-list operations, subject to supported Assist intents.
- Preserve the ability for future automations to add items even when the custom panel is closed.
- Do not claim universal voice support without end-to-end tests in the configured Assist pipeline.

## 5. Home Assistant integration implementation standards

- Implement as a properly structured custom integration under `custom_components/<domain>/` plus a separately built frontend bundle. Choose and document a unique domain before coding.
- Use `manifest.json` with version, requirements, documentation, issue tracker, integration type and appropriate dependencies; use config entries/config flow and options flow instead of requiring manual YAML.
- Follow Home Assistant async/event-loop rules; do not block the event loop with file I/O, network calls, database work or synchronous libraries.
- Use HA-managed storage and supported lifecycle methods; register/unregister listeners and panel resources correctly on setup/unload; avoid leaking tasks and subscriptions.
- Use Home Assistant's authenticated WebSocket extension mechanism for custom UI operations, with schema validation, authorization checks, bounded responses, and actionable errors. Prefer native services for standard to-do mutations.
- Register custom actions only where they add genuine functionality; validate schemas and targets. Avoid exposing unneeded services or undocumented private APIs.
- Follow Home Assistant's Integration Quality Scale and current developer documentation where applicable, including configuration, diagnostics, translations, tests, repair flows and clean unload/reload behavior.
- Use explicit capability detection and fail gracefully for unavailable, read-only or unsupported providers.
- Avoid unnecessary polling; subscribe to supported updates, and use bounded/debounced refresh or reconciliation when the underlying provider cannot push updates.

## 6. Frontend and dashboard standards

- Prefer a dedicated Home Assistant custom panel for the main application, with an optional reusable Lovelace card later.
- Use TypeScript and supported frontend APIs/components; prefer Lit/web components or another well-justified minimal approach. Avoid reliance on unstable HA internals.
- Use responsive layouts, accessible labels, visible focus, keyboard navigation, screen-reader announcements, minimum comfortable touch targets, and reduced-motion support.
- Use HA theme variables rather than hard-coded colors. Support dark mode, compact screens, landscape and large text.
- Sanitize/render Markdown safely; never inject unsanitized HTML from task notes or provider content.
- Debounce autocomplete, cancel stale requests, handle offline/reconnect, and prevent double-submit.
- Do not make users depend on hover, swipe, or drag-and-drop to complete essential operations.
- Provide clear success/failure feedback and retain unsaved edits if a write fails.

## 7. Python and code quality standards

- Target the Python version required by the supported Home Assistant release; do not pin an incompatible version.
- Follow PEP 8, modern type annotations, explicit data models, small cohesive modules, dependency injection where helpful, and separation of domain logic from HA integration glue.
- Prefer standard library and HA-provided helpers over unnecessary dependencies. Avoid global mutable state and hidden side effects.
- Use `ruff` for lint/format, `pytest` and `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` for tests; add static type checking where practical and compatible.
- Add pre-commit/`prek` checks and CI to validate Python, frontend formatting/lint/typecheck, tests, manifests, and generated bundles.
- Use structured, redacted logging with useful error context; never log task contents or credentials at debug level by default.
- Document design decisions, edge cases, failure modes and migration compatibility; keep modules and interfaces readable to future maintainers.

## 8. AI-assisted development rules

- Read current Home Assistant developer docs, relevant ADRs, integration quality rules, and repository instructions **before changing architecture or code**; do not assume remembered APIs are current.
- Follow the repository's `AGENTS.md` (to be created) and this `specs.md`; these are project-specific instructions, not substitutes for upstream Home Assistant rules.
- Make small, reviewable, test-backed changes; preserve existing behavior unless an approved requirement changes it.
- Never invent HA APIs, services, entity capabilities, imports or frontend hooks. Verify against the supported HA version or existing source/tests.
- For every change, state assumptions, affected files, security implications, test commands, results and unverified limitations.
- Run formatting, lint, tests, type checking and HA integration validation when tooling is available; never report a check as passing unless it ran successfully.
- Use fixtures and synthetic task names; do not put actual personal lists, credentials, tokens, IP addresses or account identifiers in prompts, tests, screenshots, docs or public commits.
- Do not bypass security checks, suppress failing tests, or weaken validation just to get green CI.
- Require human review before destructive migrations, external publication, or modifying live Home Assistant configuration.

## 9. Security, privacy and zero-cost requirements

- Local-first, no required telemetry, advertising, subscription, Azure billing, or third-party backend.
- Use Home Assistant authentication and permission checks. Never expose an unauthenticated HTTP endpoint or standalone server by default.
- Validate all inputs; limit note length, payload size, query result count and request rate. Protect against XSS, injection and path traversal.
- Store sensitive data only in HA-approved protected locations; exclude `.storage`, `.env`, `.secrets`, logs, exports and real task data from source control.
- Add `.gitignore`, secret scanning, dependency vulnerability scanning and CI checks for accidental disclosure. Check both staged diffs and repository history before publication.
- Use sample configuration and synthetic fixtures only; no real hostnames, LAN IPs, passwords, personal information or task content in public repository.
- No elevated privileges, host networking, shell execution or internet access required for the default local backend.
- Backups/export must be explicit and privacy-conscious. Document retention and deletion of local suggestion/metadata history.

## 10. Test and acceptance criteria

### Functional

- Multiple Local To-do lists can be selected by full name, edited and used on Android and desktop.
- Items added through panel appear in native HA `todo` entities and vice versa.
- Complete/reopen, rename, delete, search, filtering and detailed editing behave correctly.
- Rich metadata survives restart and is not lost when core task fields change.
- Autocomplete updates as user types, learns from observable additions, respects list boundaries, and can be cleared.
- Named-list Assist commands add to the correct entity; built-in Shopping list ambiguity is tested and documented.
- Provider unsupported capabilities are communicated clearly without data loss.
- Initial-release provider rebinding between two test adapters changes the selected entity without copying or deleting tasks, and preserves existing metadata associations.
- Future Option B acceptance (deferred): migration between test adapters preserves supported fields and local metadata, reports unmappable fields, and requires explicit approval.

### Reliability and security

- Integration setup, reload, unload, restart and upgrade work without duplicate listeners or lost data.
- Concurrent edits, duplicate titles, missing provider IDs, offline state, provider timeouts and stale responses are covered by tests.
- UI remains usable with keyboard and screen reader; mobile layout has no horizontal overflow.
- No credentials, personal data, addresses or real list content exist in tracked files or test fixtures.
- CI passes lint, formatting, Python tests, frontend checks, and relevant HA integration validation before release.

## 11. Suggested milestones

1. **Foundation:** repository, documentation, `AGENTS.md`, CI, secret scanning, integration scaffold, config flow, HA panel registration, Local To-do discovery/selection.
2. **Core lists UI:** named-list sidebar, responsive list view, add/edit/complete/delete, loading/error states, native entity synchronization.
3. **Rich task editor:** descriptions, notes, priority, due date, subtasks, metadata persistence and capability-aware editing.
4. **Suggestions:** central local catalog, provider history import where supported, frequency/recency ranking, autocomplete, clear-history controls.
5. **Assist and automations:** expose lists, voice test matrix, optional sentence routing, reusable scripts, end-to-end tests.
6. **Provider portability (Option A):** adapter hardening, safe rebinding, capability checks, conflict handling and validation against a second provider. Full migration preview/export/import is deferred to a separately approved future milestone (Option B).
7. **Polish/release:** accessibility, Android testing, performance, documentation, HACS distribution and release checklist.

## 12. Approved architecture decisions and open implementation details

**Approved:** Extended task data and suggestion history reside in Home Assistant-managed local storage. Initial provider portability is Option A (rebind without task migration). Option B remains a documented future goal, not an initial-release requirement. Package as one HACS-compatible custom integration with a bundled dedicated frontend panel; no standalone server or add-on is required.

**Still to determine during implementation:**

- Final integration domain/repository name.
- Whether Local To-do list creation is handled through HA's existing configuration flow or an optional guided UI.
- Metadata persistence strategy and item identity mapping for providers without stable IDs.
- Exact supported HA version baseline and compatibility matrix.
- Whether attachments are metadata-only links initially or require a secure local file-management component.
- How Assist aliases are configured and how ambiguous shopping-list phrases are handled.
